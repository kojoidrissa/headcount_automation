#What went wrong with my code?

##2013-10-08 Notes
Commit db6083 seems to be the last "good" point. I'll move head in Master back there and rerun headcountSummary.py and functionalSheets.py against the August & September 2013 raw data files. These should BOTH work without problems. 


I MAY also want to look at a diff b/w THAT commit point and the current head. I'll just need to figure out how to DO that.
