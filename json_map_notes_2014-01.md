The following cost centers are STILL in the map, but shouldn't get used in January 2014:

{
    "IT Services":
        ["61201"],
    "Quality":
        ["51346", "52A11", "57165"],
    "HSES":
        ["51247", "51270"],
    "Engineering":
        ["57100"],
    "Accounting":
        ["57619"],
    "Subsea":
        ["61201"]
}

I'm not sure if I should write some exception-testing code to see what gets done with them.
