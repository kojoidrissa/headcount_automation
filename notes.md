#formats Planning Notes
These are the planning notes for this branch (formats)

1.  Experiment with making the Headers bold. I'll make changes to the `#creating the header row` of *functionalSheets.py*, which is lines 13-20 before I start making changes
2. After that, I'll try Text alignment with the headers too
    - Left with Columns 1-6; Right with Columns 7-11
3.  Number formats (% and Acct) for Util. & Hours
