#Development Roadmap

##functionalSheets.py
-  ALL output from `funcSheets_check_figures` function  needs to be captured in a file, not just printed on screen
    -  Do I make this a log file or just add it to the Exceptions spreadsheet?
        -  The log file would be a useful exercise for me. It could be a text file that lives in that directory with a date of when it was run.
